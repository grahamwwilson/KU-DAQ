Exercise 1

Decode (preferably with a computer program) the data from the 
file, Exercise1-CH4.txt. This contains 13 events recorded on 3-20-2024 
in which in addition to the 24 kHz trigger firing on 
channel 0 (twice per event), there are two occurrences of channel 4. 
These were collected over a time interval of 4000 s, where 
a total of 96 million triggers were recorded.
It is expected that these 13 events are predominantly from cosmic-ray muons 
that stopped in the NaI scintillating crystal and subsequently decayed 
emitting an electron. The mean life of a muon at rest 
is 2.1969811(22) micro-seconds (Particle Data Group). 
The TDC was set to 25 ps resolution (aka LSB least-significant-bit).

Ideally your program prints out the 
decoded data values according to the bit-fields specified in 
the V1290 Manual (see Documents/CAEN folder) section 6, and can 
be used to do the same for future data-sets. 

Once you have the data figured out, it should be possible to calculate 
the CH4 time difference for each event, and measure the mean value for 
this sample. What is the smallest and the largest time difference observed?
What is the error on your mean?

You may also want to plot the time of arrival of the first CH4 signal with 
respect to the event trigger signal (the second CH0 time with a value 
near 45 micro-seconds). What do you expect to see? 

It would be good to get this completed by before class on Friday, March 29th.
